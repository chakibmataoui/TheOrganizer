It's the core of the program
It has 4 main functionalities : 
-Organize by Size (I may change the catsizeoffile function which generates an alert)
-Organize by Date 
-Organize by extension
-Organize by type : which uses the ExtOfFile.lot which contains the type of each file extension i did a structure by my self which i think helps more i wanted to create indexes to find faster the types but i didn't had type to do it feel free to add something 

I think the code is easy enough to understand i didn't do something big this was an easy thing but cool to do
